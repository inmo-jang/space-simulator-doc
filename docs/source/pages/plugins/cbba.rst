CBBA
=====

This is the plugin for CBBA, based on the following paper: H. Choi, L. Brunet, J.P. How, "Consensus-Based Decentralized Auctions or Robust Task Allocation", IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 25(4), 2009, pp. 912-926.

CBBA (Consensus-Based Bundle Allocation) is a decentralized method designed for MT-SR (Multiple Task - Single Robot) scenarios, where each agent performs multiple tasks sequentially, and each task requires only one agent. In CBBA, agents build task bundles by bidding on their desired tasks and sharing these bids with their neighbors. The consensus process among agents resolves conflicts and determines task assignments without requiring a central auctioneer.

Based on the original paper, the following enhancements were implemented:

- **Winning Bid Reset Mechanism**: In dynamic environments, CBBA may be required to address outdated information in winning bid/agents information. To address this issue, we introduced a mechanism where if an agent's task bundle remains empty for a certain period, it resets all known winning bid values and winning agent IDs.

An example of the parameters look like as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: plugins.cbba.cbba.CBBA
    CBBA:  
      max_tasks_per_agent: 5 
      task_reward_discount_factor: 0.999 
      winning_bid_cancel: True
      acceptable_empty_bundle_duration: 500 # sec



Parameters
----------------------

:max_tasks_per_agent:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Integer        5
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    The maximum length of the bundle that each agent can construct.

:task_reward_discount_factor:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Float          0.999
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    The discount factor used in the time-discounted reward when an agent is constructing its task path. This factor determines how rewards are discounted over time.

:winning_bid_cancel:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Boolean        True
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    Allows an agent to reset its stored winning bid and winning agent information. This parameter should be used in conjunction with ``acceptable_empty_bundle_duration``.

:acceptable_empty_bundle_duration:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Integer        500
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    When ``winning_bid_cancel`` is ``True``, this parameter defines the maximum duration (in seconds) that an agent will accept an empty bundle while still recognizing local tasks. If the bundle remains empty for longer than this duration, the agent will reset its winning bid and winning agent information.
