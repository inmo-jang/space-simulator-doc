GRAPE
=====

This is the plugin for GRAPE, based on the following paper: I. Jang, H. Shin, A. Tsourdos, "Anonymous Hedonic Game for Task Allocation in a Large-Scale Multiple Agent System", IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 34(6), 2018, pp. 1534-1548.

GRAPE is a decentralized algorithm using an anonymous hedonic game framework. Originally developed for ST-MR (Single Task - Multiple Robot) scenarios, GRAPE allows each agent to manage a single task while collaborating with multiple robots. The algorithm seeks to achieve a **Nash stable partition**, where no agent benefits from unilaterally changing its assigned tasks, thus indicating an agreed-upon task allocation among the swarm.

Based on the original paper, the following enhancements were implemented:

- **Initial Partitioning Mechanism**: For dynamic task generation scenarios, each agent can construct an initial partition where tasks are assigned based on proximity to neighboring agents. This mechanism accelerates convergence to a Nash stable partition in dynamic environments. This mechanism can be also applied during initialization and post-task completion.

- **Social Inhibition Factor**: Although GRAPE was initially designed for ST-MR (Single Task - Multiple Robot) scenarios, it has been adapted for MT-SR (Multiple Task - Single Robot) scenarios by introducing the Social Inhibition factor. This addition penalizes collaboration among agents, encouraging task dispersion and better handling of scenarios where agents need to manage multiple tasks.


An example of the parameters look like as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    plugin: plugins.grape.grape.GRAPE
    GRAPE:
      cost_weight_factor: 1.0
      social_inhibition_factor: 100
      initialize_partition: Distance # Options: None; Distance      
      reinitialize_partition_on_completion: Distance # Options: None; Distance

Parameters
----------------------

:cost_weight_factor:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Float          1.0
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    This factor is used in the calculation of an agent's individual utility. The utility is calculated as follows:

    .. image:: result/utility_function.png
       :height: 50

    where ``cost_weight_factor`` influences the weighting factor ``w_c`` for the cost component of the utility function.

:social_inhibition_factor:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Float          100
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    This factor is used in the utility calculation to penalize collaboration. In the above equation, ``social_inhibition_factor`` increases ``f_s``, which is the penalty for having more collaborators. This parameter is essential for MT-SR scenarios. However, even with a high value, agents may still collaborate if there are only a few tasks in the vicinity.

:initialize_partition:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  String         Distance
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    Determines the method for initializing the partition.

    - ``None``: Starts with an empty partition.
    - ``Distance``: Each agent creates an initial partition where tasks are assigned based on proximity, with each agent initially taking the task closest to its neighbors.

:reinitialize_partition_on_completion:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  String         Distance
  ============== =======

  **Description:**  
    Defines how the partition is handled upon task completion.

    - ``None``: No reinitialization is performed.
    - ``Distance``: Reinitializes the partition using the same distance-based mechanism as ``initialize_partition``, reallocating tasks based on proximity.
