First-Claimed Greedy
====================

This plugin implements the **First-Claimed Greedy** algorithm, a straightforward approach where each agent selects the nearest task based on local task information. The agent also considers messages from neighboring agents to avoid task conflicts.


In this algorithm, each agent follows these steps:

1. **Choose the nearest task**: The agent selects the task closest to its current position.
2. **Consider neighboring agents**: The agent checks the status of tasks claimed by neighboring agents.
3. **Handle conflicts**: If the chosen task has already been claimed by another agent, the agent abandons the task and will attempt to select a new one in the next iteration.

The **First-Claimed Greedy** algorithm ensures that an agentâ€™s initial claim on a task is upheld, and conflicts are resolved in subsequent steps. This approach minimizes task reassignment and optimizes task allocation based on proximity and real-time updates from neighboring agents.


An example of the parameters look like as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    decision_making: 
      plugin: plugins.greedy.greedy.FirstClaimGreedy
      FirstClaimGreedy:  
        mode: MinDist  # Options: Random; MinDist; MaxUtil
        weight_factor_cost: 10000.0 # Only used for `MaxUtil` mode

Parameters
----------------------

:mode:
  
  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  String         MinDist
  ============== =======
  
  **Description:**  
    Determines the logic by which an agent selects a task from the available local tasks. The options are:
    
    - ``Random``: Selects a task randomly.
    - ``MinDist``: Chooses the task that is closest to the agent.
    - ``MaxUtil``: Selects the task with the highest utility. The utility is currently calculated as:
      
      .. code-block:: python
      
          utility = task.amount - weight_factor_cost * (self.agent.position - task.position).length()
  
:weight_factor_cost:

  ============== =======
  Type           Default
  -------------- -------
  Float          10000.0
  ============== =======
  
  **Description:**  
    This parameter is used in the ``MaxUtil`` mode to influence the weighting factor for the cost component in the utility calculation. It determines the magnitude of the impact of distance on task utility.
