Running a Simulation with First-Claimed Greedy Algorithm
=============================================================

Consider the following configuration file:


.. code-block:: yaml

    decision_making: 
      plugin: plugins.greedy.greedy.FirstClaimGreedy
      FirstClaimGreedy:  
        mode: MinDist  
        weight_factor_cost: 10000.0 # Only used for `MaxUtil` mode

    agents:
      behavior_tree_xml: default_bt.xml 
      quantity: 10
      locations:
        x_min: 0
        x_max: 1400
        y_min: 0
        y_max: 1000
        non_overlap_radius: 0 
      max_speed: 0.25  
      max_accel: 0.05
      max_angular_speed: 0.25
      target_approaching_radius: 50
      work_rate: 1  
      communication_radius: 500

      random_exploration_duration: 1000.0 

    tasks:
      quantity: 100
      locations:
        x_min: 0
        x_max: 1400
        y_min: 0
        y_max: 1000

      dynamic_task_generation:
        enabled: True
        interval_seconds: 2000
        max_generations: 3
        tasks_per_generation: 25

    simulation:
      sampling_freq: 1.0 
      speed_up_factor: 0 
      max_simulation_time: 0
      agent_track_size: 400  
      screen_width: 1400 
      screen_height: 1000 
      gif_recording_fps: 0.05  
      task_visualisation_factor: 3  
      profiling_mode: False
      rendering_mode: Screen  
      rendering_options: 
        agent_tail: True
        agent_communication_topology: True
        agent_situation_awareness_circle: False
        agent_id: True
        agent_work_done: True
        agent_assigned_task_id: True
        agent_path_to_assigned_tasks: True
        task_id: False
      saving_options:
        output_folder: output
        with_date_subfolder: True
        save_gif: False
        save_timewise_result_csv: True    
        save_agentwise_result_csv: True
        save_config_yaml: True


This configuration file is the example described in the :doc:`First-Claimed Greedy <../plugins/greedy>` section. 
It demonstrates task allocation using the First-Claimed Greedy algorithm for a scenario with 10 agents and 175 tasks (initially 100 tasks, with 25 additional tasks generated every 1000 simulation-time seconds for a total of 3 times).

Save this configuration file as ``config_greedy.yaml``, and then execute the following command to run a simulation:

.. code-block:: shell

   python main.py --config=config_greedy.yaml


Then, you will see a simulation similar to the following.

Simulation Results
==================

Results Structure
---------------------

After running the simulation, the results will be saved in the ``output/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`` folder, as specified by the following settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    saving_options:
      output_folder: output
      with_date_subfolder: True

Within this folder, you will find files with names that start with ``FirstClaimGreedy_a10_t100_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS_.....``.  
The current naming convention for these result files is as follows:

- ``<decision_making_plugin_classname>_<agents_number>_<initial_tasks_number>_<timestamp>...``  



Agent-wise Results
---------------------

Letâ€™s review the results. Some of the key metrics include:

- **task_amount_done**: The total workload completed by each agent by the end of the mission.
- **distance_moved**: The total distance traveled by each agent by the end of the mission.

These metrics are saved in agent-wise CSV and PNG files as follows:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - .. code-block:: yaml

            agent_id,task_amount_done,distance_moved
            0,695.0,2093.5391205539554
            1,386.0,2356.549635838099

Time-wise Results
---------------------

We also have time-wise results as follows:

- **time**: The simulation time (not real-time). Since ``sampling_freq`` is set to ``1`` in this configuration, records are made every 1 simulation-time second.
- **agents_total_distance_moved**: The total distance traveled by all agents up to that time.
- **agents_total_task_amount_done**: The total workload completed by all agents up to that time.
- **remaining_tasks**: The number of tasks still pending at that time.
- **tasks_total_amount_left**: The total remaining workload of all pending tasks at that time.

These results are saved in time-series CSV and PNG files as follows:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - .. code-block:: yaml

            time,agents_total_distance_moved,agents_total_task_amount_done,remaining_tasks,tasks_total_amount_left
            1.0,0.5,0.0,100,3299.061134356513
            2.0,1.1075933286582644,0.0,100,3299.061134356513

You can later use the above CSV files for Monte Carlo analysis. For more details, refer to the :doc:`Conducting Monte Carlo Tests <tutorial_monte_carlo>` section.


Configuration File
---------------------

Additionally, because ``save_config_yaml: True`` is set, the configuration file used for this simulation is also saved in the output folder for backup purpose.
