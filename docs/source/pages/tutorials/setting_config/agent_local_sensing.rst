Communication Range
---------------------------------


Based on the configuration file in :ref:`tutorial_dynamic_task` section, let us observe the impact of agents' communication range. To this end, we reduce ``agents.communication_radius`` from 500 to 150 as follows: 

.. code-block:: yaml

    agents:
      behavior_tree_xml: default_bt.xml 
      ...
      communication_radius: 150 
      situation_awareness_radius: 500 
      ...

Save the configuration as ``config_grape_c150.yaml``, and then execute the following command to run a simulation:

.. code-block:: shell

   python main.py --config=config_grape_c150.yaml


Next, let us compare the results and the GIF generated in this section with those from the previous configuration.

As shown in the GIFs, in the simulation run with ``config_grape_c150.yaml``, agents must get closer to establish a communication topology. 
While the situational awareness range remains at 500, allowing agents to detect tasks from a distance, they might unknowingly select the same task due to the reduced communication range. 
As agents move closer to the task, they eventually come within the shorter communication range and become aware of the conflict. 
At that point, the conflict resolution mechanism is triggered. 
If the communication range were larger, this mechanism would have activated sooner, preventing the conflict earlier.

Note that, due to the nature of the GRAPE algorithm, if only one task is detected within the situational awareness range, agents will cooperate to complete that task.

Situational Awareness Range
---------------------------------


Based on the configuration file used above (i.e., ``config_grape_c150.yaml``), let us now observe the impact of agentsâ€™ situational awareness range. 
For this, we also reduce ``agents.situation_awareness_radius`` from 500 to 150 as follows: 


.. code-block:: yaml

    agents:
      behavior_tree_xml: default_bt.xml 
      ...
      communication_radius: 150 
      situation_awareness_radius: 150 
      ...


To visualize the impact of the reduced situational awareness range, enable the rendering option ``agent_situation_awareness_circle`` (see :ref:`tutorial_simulation_modes` for more details).


.. code-block:: yaml

    simulation:
      max_simulation_time: 15000 # 0 means no limit
      ...
      rendering_mode: Screen    
      rendering_options: 
        agent_situation_awareness_circle: True
        ...


Since the situational awareness range has been reduced, agents might not discover tasks easily, potentially causing the simulation to run for an extended period without completing the mission. 
To address this, set ``max_simulation_time`` to around 15000, ensuring that the simulation terminates if it reaches this duration.


Save the configuration as ``config_grape_c150_s150.yaml``, and then execute the following command to run a simulation:

.. code-block:: shell

   python main.py --config=config_grape_c150_s150.yaml


.. note::
    Let's also run a simulation using the configuration file ``config_grape_c150.yaml`` with the ``agent_situation_awareness_circle`` option enabled. Rename the configuration file to ``config_grape_c150_s500.yaml`` for clarity.
