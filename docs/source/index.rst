SPADE Simulator Documentation
=============================


Welcome to the official documentation for **SPADE** (Swarm Planning And Decision-making Evaluation) Simulator. 
This simulator is designed to facilitate research and development in swarm robotics and decentralized decision-making. Below are the key features of the SPADE simulator:


Key Features
------------


- **Swarm Robotics Focus**: Optimized for swarm robotics research, supporting large-scale simulations with a lightweight design.
- **Behavior Trees**: Uses behavior trees to define and manage agent behaviors, allowing for flexible and structured decision-making.   
- **Groot2 Integration**: Compatible with `Groot2 <https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot/>`_ for visualizing and editing the agents' behavior trees, enhancing ease of use and analysis.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configurable via a YAML file, enabling customization without modifying the simulatorâ€™s source code.
- **Custom Plugins**: Integrates custom decision-making algorithms as plugins, allowing for tailored testing and experimentation.
- **Local Communication and Awareness**: Agents communicate locally within specified radii and maintain situational awareness based on their situational awareness ranges.
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: Supports the creation of tasks dynamically during the simulation, adapting to evolving scenarios.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Facilitates the comparison of different decision-making algorithms within a consistent simulation environment and supports Monte Carlo tests for statistical analysis.
